## Database Setup

1. Create a database:
   - Name it `cctc-guide`.

2. Import the database:
   - Locate the `cctc-guided.sql` file in the `db` folder.
   - Import it into your database management system (using phpMyAdmin).

## Notes
- The `partials` folder is public UI (for display purposes)
- The `private` folder is after the user login meaning teacher's dashboard

- The web application is not yet finished.
- The `Admin` Feature is not yet developed

## TO DO:
   - create a basic 
      LOGIN
      REGISTER
      LOGOUT   
         forms to exchange the current complex form
   - add the complete classrooms and its names 
   - create an admin
   - (add another to do here)

## Running the Web Application

1. Ensure that your XAMMP is on.

2. Access the main entry point of the web application through your web browser:
   - [http://localhost/Classroom%20Vacancy%20Interface/index.php](http://localhost/Classroom%20Vacancy%20Interface/index.php) or simply run the `serve-server` in `index.php`.

3. To access the teacher's dashboard:
   - Visit the URL [http://localhost/Classroom%20Vacancy%20Interface/private/dashboard.php](http://localhost/Classroom%20Vacancy%20Interface/private/dashboard.php). 
   Or simply run the `serve-server` in `private/dashboard.php`.
